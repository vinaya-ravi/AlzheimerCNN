**Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Deep Learning**

**Overview**
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify Alzheimer's Disease into four stages:
**Non-Demented**
**Very Mild Demented**
**Mild Demented**
**Moderate Demented**
The model is designed to analyze medical images and provide accurate classification, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning. The dataset used is sourced from open-access repositories, ensuring diversity and reliability.

**System Design**
The classification system follows a structured pipeline:
**Dataset Preparation**: Images labeled into four classes.
**Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, resizing, and dataset splitting (80% training, 20% testing).
**Feature Extraction**: CNN extracts key features such as edges, textures, and patterns indicative of Alzheimer's Disease.
**Model Training**: The CNN is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize classification errors.
**Validation & Testing**: Model performance is evaluated on unseen data to ensure generalization.
**Result Analysis**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are computed for performance assessment.

**System Architecture**
The CNN architecture includes:
**Input Layer**: Processes preprocessed image data.
**Hidden Layers**: Convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.
**Output Layer**: Softmax activation to predict class probabilities.

**Data Flow**
Input raw dataset → Preprocessing (normalization & scaling) → Train/Test Split
Training Data → CNN Training → Model Validation → Performance Evaluation
Testing Data → Model Testing → Classification Results

**Results**
The model achieves the following performance metrics:
**Accuracy**: High classification accuracy across all four classes.
**Precision & Recall**: Reliable predictions with minimal false positives/negatives.
**Confusion Matrix**: Highlights correct classifications and areas for improvement.

**Key Insights**
The CNN effectively identifies patterns in medical images relevant to Alzheimer's Disease stages.
Performance can be further enhanced through advanced architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
The model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on unseen data.

**Conclusion**
This deep learning-based approach provides an efficient solution for Alzheimer's Disease classification, with potential applications in medical diagnostics. Future work may include deploying the model as a web application or integrating it with clinical workflows for real-time analysis.
